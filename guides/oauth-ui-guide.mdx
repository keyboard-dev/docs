## Shard connectors

The system comes with pre-configured providers you can connect to out of the box. We are always adding new connections out of the box.

Don't see one you want? You can always connect via API but reach out at [support@keyboard.dev](mailto:support@keyboard.dev) and we'll do our best to add the connection out of the box for you.

## My connectors

Add custom connections that allow you to connect your account to any third party app that supports you integrating via login. To add a new connection:

1. Navigate the **My connectors **tab (Settings \> Connetors \> My connectors
2. Select “Add Connector" at the bottom
3. Fill out the "Add a custom connector"
4. Select “Connect” to add your new connector to Keyboard
