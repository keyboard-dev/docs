## What is Keyboard MCP?

Keyboard MCP transforms your AI assistant into an automation powerhouse:

🚀 **Build applications** (React, Next.js, Express)
📊 **Create presentations** (Google Slides)  
📝 **Publish content** (Notion, blogs)
🔗 **Integrate APIs** (30+ services)
⚡ **Execute code** (GitHub Codespaces)

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/keyboard-mcp
cd keyboard-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Complete Desktop Onboarding

**🎯 Important**: Before configuring any editor, complete the desktop onboarding:

1. Download and run the Keyboard desktop app
2. Complete the onboarding flow  
3. This automatically creates your GitHub credentials and WebSocket key

**✅ After onboarding**: You can leave environment variables blank in your MCP configurations!

## MCP Client Configuration

Use these configurations with **any MCP client** that accepts JSON:

### Cursor

Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Any Other MCP Client

For any MCP client that accepts JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Manual Environment Setup (If Needed)

If you skipped desktop onboarding, add environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here",
        "SOCKET_KEY": "your_socket_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**To get GitHub token:**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
2. Create token with `codespace` + `repo` scopes
3. Add to configuration above

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Restart your editor** completely after adding configuration
2. **Enable Agent mode** in your AI chat interface
3. **Test with simple command**: *"Create a hello world React app"*

You should see keyboard tools become available in your MCP client.

## What You Can Build

**Applications**
`Build a React task management app with authentication`

**Presentations**  
`Create a Google Slides presentation about our Q3 roadmap`

**Content Creation**
`Write a comprehensive blog post about MCP servers in Notion`

**Automation Workflows**
`Set up automation that posts to Twitter when we get GitHub stars`

**API Integration**
`Build an Express API that sends welcome emails via Resend`

## Pro Tips

💡 **Start simple**: Begin with "Create a basic React app" before complex requests

💡 **Be specific**: "E-commerce site with Stripe payments" vs "build a website"

💡 **Chain commands**: "Now add user authentication" works after creating an app

💡 **Save complex workflows**: They become reusable "Keyboard Shortcuts"

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" or "File not found"**
- Use **absolute paths** to `build/index.js`, not relative paths
- Verify you ran `npm run build` successfully
- Check that `build/index.js` file exists

**"No MCP tools available"**
- Restart your editor completely after config changes
- Verify MCP support is enabled in your editor
- Check the JSON configuration syntax is valid

**"Permission denied" or "Authentication failed"**  
- Complete the desktop onboarding process first, OR
- Manually add `GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN` and `SOCKET_KEY` to env section

**"Agent mode not available"**
- Install GitHub Copilot extension (VS Code/Cursor)
- Ensure your editor supports MCP
- Enable MCP settings in your editor preferences

**Build failures**
- Ensure Node.js version 18+ is installed
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Check for any error messages during `npm run build`

## Key Success Factors

✅ **Complete desktop onboarding** - handles authentication automatically

✅ **Use absolute file paths** - relative paths often fail

✅ **Build first** - always run `npm run build` before configuration

✅ **Restart your editor** - required after configuration changes

✅ **Universal compatibility** - works with any MCP client accepting JSON
