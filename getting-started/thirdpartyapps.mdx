## Out of the box connectors

Keyboard supports 

## Connecting apps via API

### Navigate to Repo Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository that was created during the onboarding process, it should have the name "codespace-executor".
2. Click on the **Settings** tab (you need admin access)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables**
4. Click **Codespaces**

### Add Repo Secrets

1. Click **New repository secret**
2. Enter the secret name with **KEYBOARD\_** prefix in the following format KEYBOARD_APPNAME_API_KEY (e.g. KEYBOARD_TYPEFORM_API_KEY)
3. Enter the secret value (your actual API key)
4. Click **Add secret**

<Tip>
  **Tips**

  - Once you've added the secrets you will have to reset any codespaces already running (you can ask Keyboard to delete existing codespaces)
  - _Ask your AI client connected to Keyboard "what environment variables does Keyboard have access" to in order to confirm the connection worked_
  - Start asking your AI to perform tasks in your connected apps once it confirms it has access
</Tip>

## Connecting apps via MCP (coming soon!)

The ability to connect apps via MCP is not supported by Keyboard today but is on the roadmap. Reach out at [support@keyboard.dev](mailto:support@keyboard.dev) if this is something you're looking for and we'll ensure you can connect the apps you want (and move this feature up the priority list!). 

## Brosweruse (coming soon!)

Soon you will be able to use Keyboard to have your AI work in your connected apps via the browser if there is no API or MCP. Reach out at [support@keyboard.dev](mailto:support@keyboard.dev) if this is something you're looking for and we'll ensure you can connect the apps you want (and move this feature up the priority list!). 

## Security overview

### What does Keyboard have access to?

Keyboard does not have access to the API keys you input. Those are stored in your private GitHub repo. Keyboard only knows that the environment variable is available to point Claude to when ready to execute a task. By default you will always have the ability to to approve or deny any task before Claude goes and executes a task leveraging the API key (_you can also turn this final approval off if you want_).

### Best practices for AI-driven environment variable naming

**Do:**

- Use uppercase names with the **KEYBOARD\_** prefix
- Include the service name in the variable name
- Use consistent naming patterns across your project

**Examples of environment variable names:**

```markdown
# Third-Party Integration Secrets
KEYBOARD_TYPEFORM_API_KEY
KEYBOARD_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
KEYBOARD_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
KEYBOARD_SENDGRID_API_KEY
KEYBOARD_SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL
KEYBOARD_ASANA_API_KEY
KEYBOARD_GOOGLE_SLIDES_API_KEY
KEYBOARD_GOOGLE_DOCS_API_KEY_READ_ONLY
KEYBOARD_GITHUB_TOKEN_FOR_API
```

### Avoid these common mistakes

- Generic names like KEY, SECRET, or TOKEN
- Lowercase or mixed-case names
- Ambiguous abbreviations
- Storing secrets in code or configuration files
- Using production keys in development environments
