## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the latest keyboard dxt file installed [here](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-mcp/releases/latest)
- Have the latest version [Keyboard's Desktop App](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/approver-client/releases/latest)
- Have a MCP client like Claude Desktop or Cursor
- Have gone through steps in the [quckstart](/getting-started/quickstart)

## Fork the app-builder repo

First you have to fork a repo dedicated to creating applications. Fork it [here](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/app-creator/fork).

## Update the permissions to your GitHub PAT

Once you fork the app-creator repo you have to update the access on your GitHub PAT to have access to the repo as well. Navigate [here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) to find your GitHub PAT tokens. Once there find the GitHub PAT token you created for Keyboard and click on it's name.\
\
You should see there it only has access to a repo called "codespace-executor".
