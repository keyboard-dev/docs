# How to use OAuth connections

## Getting started

OAuth connections allow you to securely connect to external services like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft without sharing your passwords. The system uses industry-standard security to keep your data safe.

## Accessing OAuth settings

1. **Open Settings**: In the Desktop App, click the settings icon or navigate to the Settings panel
2. **Navigate to OAuth**: You'll see four tabs at the top:
   - WebSocket
   - Encryption
   - **OAuth Providers** ← Click here for direct connections
   - **Server Providers** ← Click here for server-managed connections

---

## OAuth Providers tab

This is where you manage direct connections to services using your own app credentials.

### What you'll see

**Provider Cards**: Each service appears as a card showing:

- **Provider icon and name** (e.g., Google, GitHub)
- **Connection status**: "Not Connected", "Connected", or "Expired"
- **Scopes**: What permissions the app has access to
- **Action buttons**: Connect, Refresh, Token, Disconnect

### Built-in providers

The system comes with pre-configured providers:

#### Google 🔍

- **Status shown**: Connected/Expired/Not Connected
- **Scopes**: openid, email, profile, drive.readonly, gmail.readonly, spreadsheets, presentations, drive.file
- **What you can do**: Access Google Drive, Gmail, Sheets, Slides

#### GitHub 🐙

- **Scopes**: user:email, repo
- **What you can do**: Access repositories and user profile data

### Connecting to a provider

1. **Find the provider card** you want to connect to
2. **Check requirements**: If you see ⚠️ "This provider needs a Client ID to be configured", you'll need to add credentials first
3. **Click "Connect"** button
4. **Browser opens**: You'll be redirected to the provider's login page
5. **Sign in**: Enter your credentials on the provider's website
6. **Grant permissions**: Review and approve the requested access
7. **Return to app**: You'll be redirected back automatically
8. **Success**: The card now shows "Connected" with a green badge

### Managing connected providers

Once connected, you'll see additional options:

#### 📋 Copy token

- Click to copy your access token to clipboard
- Use this token in other applications or scripts
- **Security note**: Tokens are sensitive - don't share them

#### 🔄 Refresh (if expired)

- Appears when your connection has expired
- Click to get a new access token
- Usually happens automatically

#### ❌ Disconnect

- Removes the connection and deletes stored tokens
- You'll need to reconnect to use the service again

## Adding custom providers

Need to connect to a service that's not built-in? You can add your own\!

### Step 1: Click "➕ Add Provider"

Located at the top of the OAuth Providers tab.

### Step 2: Fill out the form

You'll see a form with these fields:

#### Required fields ⚠️

  - Cannot be changed after creation
  - Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- **Display Name**: What users see (like "Slack" or "Discord")
- **Client ID**: From your OAuth app settings
- **Authorization URL**: Where users go to log in
- **Token URL**: Where the app exchanges codes for tokens

#### Optional fields

- **Icon**: Emoji to represent the service (🔗 is default)
- **Client Secret**: Some services require this
- **User Info URL**: To fetch user profile data
- **Scopes**: What permissions to request
- **Redirect URI**: Usually http://localhost:8082/callback

#### Quick templates

The form includes buttons for popular services:

- **Google** 🔍: Pre-fills Google's settings
- **GitHub** 🐙: Pre-fills GitHub's settings
- **Microsoft** 🪟: Pre-fills Microsoft's settings
- **Discord** 💬: Pre-fills Discord's settings

### Step 3: Save and connect

1. Click "✅ Add Provider"
2. Your new provider appears in the list
3. Click "Connect" to set up the connection

## Server Providers tab

Server Providers let you connect through centralized OAuth servers managed by your organization.

### What you'll see

**Server List**: Shows configured OAuth servers with:

- **Server name and URL** (e.g., "My OAuth Server" at https://api.keyboard.dev)
- **Available providers** from that server
- **Connection status** for each provider
- **Remove button** to delete servers

### Adding a server

1. **Click "Add Server"** button (top right)
2. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Server Name**: Friendly name for your server
   - **Server URL**: The server's base URL (e.g., http://localhost:4000)
3. **Click "Add Server"**
4. **Server appears** in the list and fetches available providers

### Using server providers

Once a server is added:

#### Available providers section

Shows providers configured on that server:

- **🟢 Green dot**: Provider is configured and ready
- **🔴 Red dot**: Provider needs server-side setup
- **Provider name**: Like "Google" or "X"
- **Connection status**: Connected/Expired/Not Connected

#### Connecting through server

1. **Find a provider** with green status dot
2. **Click "🔗 Connect"**
3. **OAuth flow begins** (same as direct providers)
4. **Authentication managed** by the server

#### Managing server connections

Connected providers show:

- **📋 Token**: Copy access token
- **🔄 Refresh**: Get new token (if expired)
- **❌ Disconnect**: Remove connection

## Understanding connection status

### Status indicators

#### 🟢 Connected

- You're successfully authenticated
- Tokens are valid and not expired
- Ready to use the service

#### 🔴 Expired

- Your access token has expired
- Click "🔄 Refresh" to get a new one
- May happen automatically in background

#### ⚪ Not connected

- No active connection to this service
- Click "🔗 Connect" to set up authentication

### User information

When connected, you'll see:

- **👤 User name or email**
- **📅 Connection date**: When you first connected
- **🔄 Last updated**: When tokens were last refreshed

---

## Managing your vonnections

### Top-level actions

#### 🔄 Refresh

Updates the list of all providers and their status.

#### 🗑️ Clear all

**⚠️ Careful\!** This removes ALL OAuth connections at once.

- Appears when you have active connections
- Requires confirmation before proceeding
- Cannot be undone

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

#### "No Client ID" warning

**What it means**: The provider needs OAuth app credentials to work.

**How to fix**:

1. Edit the provider (✏️ button)
2. Add your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Save changes and try connecting again

#### "Authentication Error"

**What might be wrong**:

- Incorrect Client ID or Client Secret
- Wrong redirect URI in your OAuth app settings
- Service is temporarily unavailable

**What to try**:

1. Double-check your OAuth app settings
2. Ensure redirect URI is http://localhost:8082/callback
3. Try refreshing the page and connecting again

#### "Token Expired"

**Normal behavior**: Tokens expire for security.

**What to do**:

1. Click "🔄 Refresh" button
2. If refresh fails, click "❌ Disconnect" then "🔗 Connect" again

## Security notes

### What's protected

- **🔐 All tokens encrypted**: Stored securely on your device
- **🛡️ PKCE security**: Protection against code interception
- **🔒 File permissions**: Storage files are locked to your user account
- **⏰ Token expiration**: Automatic cleanup of old tokens

### Best practices

- **🔄 Regular refresh**: Let the system refresh tokens automatically
- **❌ Disconnect unused**: Remove providers you no longer need
- **👀 Review scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **🔐 Keep credentials secure**: Don't share Client IDs or secrets
