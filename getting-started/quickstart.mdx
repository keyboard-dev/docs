  - Claude Desktop installed (See [here](https://docs.keyboard.dev/getting-started/other-mcp-clients) to use Keyboard with other AI clients)

### Install Keyboard desktop app

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Download and open the desktop app">
    Download the Keyboard desktop app [here](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/approver-client/releases/latest). Just unzip it and run. Follow the steps in the app to create an account and connect your GitHub to get started.

    <Info>
      Connecting GitHub will \_only \_provide Keyboard with the ability to start and stop codespaces on **public repositories** and automatically create forks of two Keyboard's [codespace-executor](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/codespace-executor) and [app-creator](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/app-creator) repositories.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Git Clone the approver app">
    For running the code and desktop app yourself, copy the commands below. This is useful if you want to contribute to project.

    ```
    # Get access to both repos
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-local.git
    cd keyboard-local
    
    # Work on desktop electron app
    cd apps/approver-client
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

    Now run the project.

    ```
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # run the Electron App

That's it! Setup is done.

```

Keyboard will plan, create a codespace, connect to a websocket, and run code that you will be notified to approve in the Keyboard Approver.

    - Ensure you have Keyboard open
    - Ask Claude to connect to Keyboard
    - Specifically call out Keyboard in your prompt (i.e. Use Keyboard to...)
    - Ensure you have given Keyboard access to the app via [these steps](https://docs.keyboard.dev/getting-started/thirdpartyapps)
    - Ask Claude what environment variables it is connected to and ensure that it has access to the API of the tool you are trying to use
