## Getting started

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:

  - Node.js version 18 or higher
  - Claude Desktop, with an account that can add integrations and MCP servers (other clients coming soon)
  - MacOS (for now) - This guide and the current release are for Mac users. We're working on support for other platforms.
</Info>

### Fork the Codespace repo

Fork this [repo](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/codespace-executor).

### Generate a GitHub PAT for the Codespace repo

Navigate to GitHub ([here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)) to generate a fine-grained GitHub PAT that only has access to the codespace-executor repo you forked and has the following codespaces permissions below (screenshots to follow):

- Codespaces: **Read and write**
- Codespaces lifecycle admin: **Read and write**
- Codespaces metadata: **Read-only**
- Metadata: **Read-only** (this is preselected and mandatory on all fine-grained GitHub PATs)

<Info>
  If you are unfamiliar with GitHuB Personal Access Tokens (PAT) then refer to GitHub's docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) for more info.
</Info>

Be sure to copy the generated PAT as you will need to paste it in the next step.

  <Tab title="Option 2: Git Clone the Approver app">
    For running the code and desktop app yourself, copy the commands below. This is useful if you want to contribute to project.

    ```
    # Get access to both repos
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-local.git
    cd keyboard-local

    cd apps/approver-client
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

    Now run the project.

    ```
    # Install dependencies
    npm install

Now after you save make sure Keyboard is enabled.

![Screenshot 2025-07-28 at 4.30.21 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-07-28at4.30.21PM.png)

That's it\! Setup is done.

## Try your first prompt

Navigate back to the Claude chat in your Claude Desktop and try a prompt like this:

```markdown
Can you run hello world code with Keyboard?
```

![Screenshot 2025-07-28 at 4.31.46 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-07-28at4.31.46PM.png)

Keyboard will plan, create a codespace, connect to a websocket, and run code that you will be notified to approve in the Keyboard Approver.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude is not performing the requested task">
    If Claude is trying to give you instructions or isn't performing the requested task you can try the following steps:

    - Ensure you have Keyboard open
    - Ask Claude to connect to Keyboard
    - Specifically call out Keyboard in your prompt (i.e. Use Keyboard to...)
    - Ensure you have given Keyboard access to the app via [these steps](https://docs.keyboard.dev/getting-started/thirdpartyapps)
    - Ask Claude what environment variables it is connected to and ensure that it has access to the API of the tool you are trying to use
